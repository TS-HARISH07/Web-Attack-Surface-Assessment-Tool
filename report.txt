Web Attack Surface Assessment Report

Target: http://testphp.vulnweb.com

Summary:
A basic web reconnaissance and security header analysis was performed.

Findings:
- Multiple HTTP security headers were missing.
- No robots.txt file was accessible.
- No common sensitive directories were exposed.

Impact:
Missing security headers increase the risk of clickjacking, XSS,
and protocol downgrade attacks.

Conclusion:
The target application exhibits security misconfigurations
that should be addressed to reduce attack surface exposure.

Additional Testing:
- Reflected XSS testing was performed using controlled payloads.
- No unsanitized input reflection was observed.

Note:
Absence of reflected XSS does not guarantee complete immunity
against other XSS types such as stored or DOM-based XSS.
